# What is this?

This code uses natural language tools and methods to analyze 6500 contracts from the City of New Orleans. Specifically, it tries to answer two questions:

  -  **How much is each contract worth?** The city does not post the value of each contract on its website. So there is no way to know how much money has been promised or spent.  
  - **What kinds of contracts does the city post?** Many different kinds of "contracts" wash up on the city's purchasing portal. Each has different langauge, requiring different kinds of analysis. Can the 6500 contracts be broken into smaller families? For instance, can we distinguish between leases, film permits and cooperative endevor agreements?
