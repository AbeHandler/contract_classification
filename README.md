# What is this?

This code uses natural language tools and methods to analyze 6500 contracts from the City of New Orleans. Specifically, it tries to answer two questions:

  -  **How much is each contract worth?** The city does not post the value of each contract on its website. So when the city signs a contract, there is no way to know how much money has been spent.  
  - **What kinds of contracts does the city post on its purchasing site?** Many different kinds of "contrcats" wash up on the city's purchasing site. Each kind of "contract" has different sorts of  langauge, so its hard to analyze the text of all of these contracts in the same way. Can the contracts be split into families? For instance, can we distinguish between amended contracts and film permits?
